# Card

Use cards to highlight navigation targets, related reading, or key callouts directly inside your MDX content.

<Card title="Track progress" icon="panel-left-close" href="/docs/roadmap">
  Keep an eye on the public roadmap and see which features are shipping next.
</Card>

```jsx
<Card title="Track progress" icon="panel-left-close" href="/docs/roadmap">
  Keep an eye on the public roadmap and see which features are shipping next.
</Card>
```

## Horizontal layout

Add the `horizontal` prop when you want the icon and content to line up on a single row.

<Card title="Horizontal card" icon="scroll-text" horizontal>
  This layout works well when cards appear in a column grid or next to tables.
</Card>

```jsx
<Card title="Horizontal card" icon="scroll-text" horizontal>
  This layout works well when cards appear in a column grid or next to tables.
</Card>
```

## Custom CTA and arrows

Set the `cta` text to add a small call to action and control whether an arrow is shown with the `arrow` prop. Arrows show automatically for external links, so the manual override is useful for internal links or button-less layouts. You can also change the icon color or pass a JSX icon directly if you need more control.

<Card title="Custom icon color" icon="sparkles" color="#f97316">
  Icons accept Lucide names as strings or JSX components. Use the `color` prop to match a brand or
  category.
</Card>

```

<Card
  title="Read the docs"
  icon="book-open"
  href="https://github.com/prose-ui/prose-ui"
  cta="Visit GitHub"
  horizontal
  arrow="true"
>
  Explore the repository to browse the source, open issues, or contribute improvements.
</Card>

```jsx
<Card
  title="Read the docs"
  icon="book-open"
  href="https://github.com/prose-ui/prose-ui"
  cta="Visit GitHub"
  horizontal
  arrow="true"
/>
```

## Use with Columns

Combine cards inside the `Columns` layout to build responsive grids. By default, columns collapse to a single column on small screens.

<Columns columns={2}>
  <Card title="Start here" icon="book-open" href="/docs">
    Read the documentation to get up and running with Prose UI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="View components" icon="panel-left-close" href="/docs/components/overview">
    See the full list of components you can use in MDX.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customize styles" icon="sparkles" href="/docs/styling">
    Learn how to tailor the design tokens to your brand.
  </Card>
</Columns>

```jsx
<Columns columns={2}>
  <Card title="Start here" icon="book-open" href="/docs">...</Card>
  <Card title="View components" icon="panel-left-close" href="/docs/components/overview">...</Card>
  <Card title="Customize styles" icon="sparkles" href="/docs/styling">...</Card>
</Columns>
```
