<Subtitle>Why Prose UI exists, where it's headed, and how you can help.</Subtitle>

I started Prose UI while building a visual editor for [**dhub**](https://dhub.dev), a CMS for technical documentation.
One of the biggest hurdles was consistency: every framework has its own conventions for MDX components, and most projects end up with a different (and often incomplete) set of building blocks.

Prose UI is my attempt to make that experience predictable: a shared set of polished, MDX-ready components and typography styles that can be used across frameworks, whether you're using Docusaurus or a plain Next.js app, while still being easy to customize.

If you want to follow updates or reach out, I'm Valdemaras ([@vrepsys on X](https://x.com/vrepsys)). I'm also available for contract work. I build full-stack products, from APIs and backend systems to real-time collaboration and complex UIs.

## Contributing

If something feels off, breaks in your setup, or could be improved, I'd really appreciate it if you open an issue on GitHub and share the details. Even better, open a PR if you already have a fix.

## Credits

Huge thanks to my friend [**Domas**](https://domasmark.us/) for his help with the design and for pushing the visual direction to be as clean and usable as it is.
