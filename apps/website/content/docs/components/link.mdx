# Link

Prose UI converts all links to internal pages into the [Next.js Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link).
This allows Next.js to prefetch pages when the link enters the user's viewport (e.g., during scrolling), ensuring the page opens instantly when the user clicks the link.

For more advanced use cases, you can use the Next.js Link component directly in your MDX files without importing it explicitly.
