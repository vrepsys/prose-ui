# Roadmap

While we have many ideas for Prose UI, we try to prioritize quality over quantity, so a lot of functionality we'd love to have is still not there.
Here's what's planned for the future:

- Image zoom (click to expand, gallery view)
- LaTeX support for mathematical notation
- Tabbed interfaces, including code block tabs for multiple languages
- Line highlighting in code blocks
- API reference components
- Support for other frameworks (Astro) and generic React projects (not just Next.js)

Got ideas or just want to chat about Prose UI? [Drop me a line](https://x.com/vrepsys)â€”I'd love to hear your thoughts!
