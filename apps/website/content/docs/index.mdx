# Introduction 

Prose UI is an open-source library of components and [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) plugins, designed to simplify rendering [MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) content with beautiful, consistent styles.

With Prose UI, you have a straightforward way to bring polished typography and thoughtfully designed [components](/docs/components/overview) to your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) documentation, blog, or any content-focused site.

<Callout variant="info" title="Next.js compatibility">
  Prose UI currently works only with Next.js. We rely on `next/link` and `next/image` to power links and images.
