# How it works

If you just want to start using Prose UI quickly, feel free to jump to the [installation](/docs/installation) guide or begin with one of the [templates](/templates).

Prose UI consists for 3 main elements:
- **React components**\
Available in `@prose-ui/next`
- **CSS styles**\
Available in `@prose-ui/next/prose-ui.css`
- **Remark plugins**\
Available in `@prose-ui/core`

## React components

The `mdxComponents` array from `@prose-ui/next` includes React server components necessary for rendering elements such as highlighted code blocks, callouts, images, headings, and frames.

```js
import { mdxComponents } from "@prose-ui/next"
```

Prose UI also exports these components individually for use outside of MDX.

```js
import { CodeBlock, Frame, Callout, Image, Heading } from "@prose-ui/next"
```

## CSS styles

CSS styles from `@prose-ui/next/prose-ui.css` provide default styles for typography and Prose UI components, scoped under the `prose-ui` ancestor CSS class.

In Next.js, it's recommended to import these styles into your `globals.css` file:

```css title="globals.css"
@import '@prose-ui/next/prose-ui.css'
```

Prose UI uses the presence of the `dark` CSS class on the `<html>` element to determine whether to render content in dark mode.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Customize styles">
The easiest way to customize styles is by overriding the CSS variables defined in [`@prose-ui/next/prose-ui.css`](https://github.com/vrepsys/prose-ui/blob/main/packages/next/prose-ui.css).

## Remark plugins

The `remarkPlugins(options)` function from `@prose-ui/core` enables essential 
features such as converting Markdown images to optimized `next/image` components 
and Markdown links to `next/link` components.

```typescript
import { remarkPlugins } from '@prose-ui/core'
```

The function accepts an optional `options` object, and returns an arary of remark plugins you can use to set up your MDX renderer.
Here's an example:

```typescript
const plugins = remarkPlugins({
  image: {
    imageDir: './public',
  },
})
```
