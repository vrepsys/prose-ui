## Math formulas

Prose UI supports inline and block math formulas using LaTeX syntax. Formulas are rendered using KaTeX, providing beautiful mathematical notation.

### Inline math

Use single dollar signs `$...$` for inline math formulas that appear within a paragraph.

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ for solving equations.

The famous equation $E = mc^2$ relates energy and mass. Another example: $F = ma$ represents Newton's second law of motion.

### Block math

Use double dollar signs `$$...$$` on separate lines for block math formulas that appear as standalone, centered equations.

The quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Integral notation:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
