# Roadmap

Prose UI started with a simple goal: to provide a consistent MDX experience with standardized components. 
We wanted to make it easier for anyone building content-focused websites—whether it's a blog, documentation site, knowledge base, or even a full documentation framework—to drop Prose UI into their project without reinventing the wheel.

While there's a lot we dream of adding to Prose UI, our focus is on quality over quantity. 
We want every feature to work seamlessly and every design element to feel just right. A huge thanks goes to [Domas](https://domasmark.us) for his invaluable design contributions—Prose UI wouldn't be what it is without his help.

Here’s what’s coming next:

- Image zoom
- Support for LaTeX formulas
- Tabs component, including for code blocks
- Line highlighting in code blocks
- API reference components to document your APIs

Have ideas, feature requests, or just want to chat? [Get in touch](https://x.com/vrepsys)—we’d love to hear from you!
