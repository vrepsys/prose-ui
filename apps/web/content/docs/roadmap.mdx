While we have many ideas for Prose UI, we try to prioritize quality over quantity, so a lot of functionality we'd love to have is still not there.
Here's what's planned for the future:

- Tabbed interfaces, including code block tabs for multiple languages
- Line highlighting in code blocks
- API reference components
- Support forAstro
