# Link

<Subtitle>Framework-aware links for MDX content.</Subtitle>

Prose UI converts Markdown links into the `Link` MDX component and renders it differently based on your framework:
- With `@prose-ui/next`, it becomes the [Next.js Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) so internal routes prefetch automatically.
- With `@prose-ui/react` (no Next.js), it renders a plain `<a>` element to keep links working in any React environment.

If you need a custom implementation, override the `Link` MDX component:

```tsx
import { createMdxComponents } from '@prose-ui/react'
import { Link as RouterLink } from 'your-router'

export const mdxComponents = createMdxComponents({
  Link: (props) => <RouterLink {...props} />,
})
```
