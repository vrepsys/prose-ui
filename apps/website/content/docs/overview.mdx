# Overview

This page provides an overview of how Prose UI works, its main concepts, and the elements that make up the library.

## React components

The `mdxComponents` array from `@prose-ui/next` includes React server components necessary for rendering elements such as highlighted code blocks, callouts, images, headings, and frames.

```js
import { mdxComponents } from "@prose-ui/next"
```

Prose UI also exports these components individually for use outside of MDX.

```js
import { CodeBlock, Frame, Callout, Image, Heading } from "@prose-ui/next"
```

## CSS styles

CSS styles from `@prose-ui/next/prose-ui.css` provide default styles for typography and Prose UI components, scoped under the `prose-ui` ancestor CSS class.

In Next.js, it's recommended to import these styles into your `globals.css` file:

```css title="globals.css"
@import '@prose-ui/next/prose-ui.css'
```

Prose UI uses the presence of the `dark` CSS class on the `<html>` element to determine whether to render content in dark mode.

## Remark plugins

The `remarkPlugins(options)` function from `@prose-ui/core` enables essential features such as converting Markdown images to optimized `next/image` components and Markdown links to `next/link` components. These plugins are crucial for Prose UI to function properly.

```typescript
import { remarkPlugins } from '@prose-ui/core'
```
